I quite enjoy writing CSS, so I'm trying to replicate some known web interfaces and today I made a clone of TweetDeck. The clone has no functionality and the icons are placeholder icons, but most of styling and elements are there.

You can preview the clone [here]({{site.baseurl}}/c/css-examples/tweetdeck).
