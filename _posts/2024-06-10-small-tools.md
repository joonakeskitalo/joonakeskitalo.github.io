I like creating small purpose built tools if there is no clear alternative with the same feature set. Some of the tools I've made:

<br/>

#### [Markdown to RTF](https://joonakeskitalo.github.io/markdown-to-rtf)

Convert Markdown to RTF to be used with tools that don't have Markdown support out of the box, such as Confluence, Jira, Teams, Email and so on.

#### [Daily meeting notes template generator](https://joonakeskitalo.github.io/daily/)

Creates a daily template with current date, each team members name in a randomised order and allows you to copy the written Markdown text as formatted rich text.

Example:

```
### 2025-10-06 daily

**Elias**

**Aino**

```

#### [JS Eval scriptpad](https://joonakeskitalo.github.io/eval-pad)

Write small snippets of JS and instantly run them with ctrl+space hotkey. Allows for text input and output, so you can quickly reformat JSON, parse CSV etc.

#### [Bulk QR and EAN-13 code generator](https://joonakeskitalo.github.io/ean-qr-generator)

Generate 1D or 2D barcodes in bulk. Runs locally, uses [bwip-js](http://metafloor.github.io/bwip-js) for generating barcodes and codes are only shown when mousing over the it to make it easier to read the correct code with a device.
