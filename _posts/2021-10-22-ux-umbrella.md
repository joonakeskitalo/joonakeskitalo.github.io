**UX design** is an umbrella term which encompasses multiple terms within itself.

---

**Visual design**<br/>
Focuses on how the product looks. Colors, fonts, shapes, textures, hierarchy, balance, contrast, scale, unity & similarity.

**Information architecture (IA)**<br/>
How the content is organised and structured with the goal of helping the user find information they were looking for. Includes navigation, metadata, labelling, search, sitemap, etc.

**Interaction design**<br/>
- Behaviour and interaction between user and service.
- Define how users can interact with the interface.
- Give users clues about behaviour before actions are taken.
- Anticipate and mitigate errors: Constraints to prevent errors & useful feedback messages.
- System feedback and response time
- Think about elements: Are you following common standards and conventions? Are buttons and menus placed logically?

**Usability**<br/>
How well users can learn to use a product & achieve their goals. Intuitive design, easy of learning, efficiency, memorability, error frequency and subjective satisfaction.

**User research**<br/>
Understanding your users. What do they want or need? How do they use something? Generally split into two forms of research, which should be combined for the optimal result:
- *Qualitative research*: Why users do what they do? Usually done via interviews, field studies, usability testing & monitoring.
- *Quantitive research*: What users do and test assumptions from qualitative research. Surveys, analytics.

**Content strategy**<br/>
Planning, creation and management of content. Includes words, images and other multimedia.
