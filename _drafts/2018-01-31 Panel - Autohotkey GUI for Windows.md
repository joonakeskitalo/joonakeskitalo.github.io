During the summer I worked at a small IT shop doing basic installations of computers for clients. Since 99% of the computers went to random places, things such as volume licensing or AD weren't an option for easy installation and setup.

Microsoft kept re-arranging the Control Panel & Settings application in every update, so it was pretty infuriating to try to do anything and had to keep searching for basic settings,  so I decided to create a simple program/GUI in Autohotkey.

I call it Panel, the missing GUI for Windows.
Repository and compiled exe's are available on [Github](https://github.com/Joonikko/Panel)

It's made with [Autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) and the installation functionality uses the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/).

**Features**

- GUI with buttons to quickly access settings, folders etc.
- *Ninite-style* GUI for installing applications via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
	- To use the installation feature, you need to have Chocolatey installed or install it with clicking the *CMD-* or *PS Install* buttons, which will run the command to install Chocolatey.
- KDE-style alt+drag window moving and resizing. Original script by [Jonny](https://autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/EasyWindowDrag_(KDE).htm) from [Autohotkey script showcase](https://autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/)
