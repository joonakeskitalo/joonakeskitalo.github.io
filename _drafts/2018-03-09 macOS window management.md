### macOS window management


For Windows users who haven't used macOS before, the windowing can seem a bit weird. There isn't Windows-style alt-tab that will show and change to any window open on the system, but there are two hotkeys to change application and then change the window in that application, which is convenient when you want to find a specific document in a text editor without having to go through *every* open window.

- CMD + tab = change application
- CMD + tilde = change window

**Custom hotkeys**

I have hotkeys to show/hide commonly used applications:
- ctrl + Q = Spark (email)
- ctrl + W = Sublime Text
- ctrl + E = Enpass
- ctrl + R = CotEditor
- ctrl + T = iTerm2
- ctrl + F = Finder
- ctrl + G = Fileloupe
- ctrl + Z = Safari
- ctrl + X = iA Writer
- ctrl + C = Chrome

With these hotkeys, changing applications is a breeze. No more looking for a window, cmd-tabbing or clicking on icons. Once you've made & memorized your own hotkeys, the application just appears out of muscle memory.

There are a lot of programs that can application switching, I use Keyboard Maestro because it has a lot more functionality that I would also use, but free applications such [Apptivate](http://www.apptivateapp.com) is great.

Window resizing and moving on macOS is quite tedious and bad by default, but I use an application called [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/), which allows me to drag the size of the window on a grid and set hotkeys to specific sizes. I basically only use the hotkeys. There is no syncing in Divvy, but you can use `divvy://export` in Safari's URL bar to copy the configuration to your clipboard and then import it on an another machine.

If you don't need the custom sizes and grid of Divvy, you can use free alternative such as [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com), which has all of the basic sizes (left/right side, fullscreen etc.)
